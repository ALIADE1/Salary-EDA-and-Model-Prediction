## Key Features

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Investigates the structure and distribution of the dataset.
- Analyzes key features and their relationships to salary.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Encodes categorical features using **Label Encoding**.
- Scales numerical features with **StandardScaler**.
- Splits the dataset into training and testing subsets for predictive modeling.

### 3. Predictive Modeling
- Implements a **Linear Regression** model to predict salaries.
- Evaluates the model using metrics such as:
  - **Accuracy Score**
  - **R2 Score**
