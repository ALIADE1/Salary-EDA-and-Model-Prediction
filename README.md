https://www.kaggle.com/code/a7lia8del/salary-eda-model-prediction

## Overview
This project explores salary data using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and applies **Machine Learning models** to predict salaries. The dataset is analyzed for insights, and various preprocessing techniques are used to build an effective model.

## Dataset
The dataset contains salary-related information, including categorical and numerical features. It undergoes preprocessing before being used for model training.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Import dataset
   - Handle missing values
   - Summary statistics and visualizations

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling
   - Train-test split

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
   - Feature correlation analysis
   - Salary distribution insights

4. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Training models like **Linear Regression**
   - Evaluating performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
